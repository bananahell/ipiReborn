# My IPI projects - Reborn

I have done an [Introduction to Image Processing course](https://github.com/bananahell/TrabIPI2017) back in 2017, and since then I have always wanted to revisit it.  
I loved the class, I remember the code and my git being very badly structured overall, and I wanna make my [boii reeves](https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelReeves) proud someday, and those are the reasons I'm wasting my timed vacation doing this kind of shit.  

## Code structure

I will leave all of my code in the ./code folder, .cpp in ./code/src and .h in ./code/include.
